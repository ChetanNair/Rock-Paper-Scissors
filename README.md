The user can play a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer. The program uses input from the webcam to capture the user's move (rock, paper or scissors) and the computer also generates its move. The winner is calculated and the scores and incremented appropriately. Ties contribute zero points while invalid hand signs are reported as invalid by the program.
